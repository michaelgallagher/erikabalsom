  <p><i>Cutaways</i></p>
  <p class="further">A book series published by Fordham University Press, co-edited with Genevieve Yue</p>
  <p class="curating-explanation"><i>Cutaways</i> is a series of pocket-sized books by and for cinephiles. Each volume offers a journey through the history of cinema guided by a single motif or formal device. Adopting an essayistic style free of jargon and imbued with each authorâ€™s unique voice, the books create a space for intellectually engaged and broadly accessible cinephilia, bringing together expertise, eclecticism, provocation, and passion.</p>
  <p class="curating-explanation with-indent"><i>Cutaways</i> offers inspiring and unlikely conversations with and among films. Each volume considers popular and lesser-known films from around the world, ranging from early cinema to contemporary releases, and from Hollywood to documentary and the avant-garde. Breaking with the categories of author, nation, and period that govern so much writing on cinema, the motif-based approach allows for classic films to appear in a new light and for relatively unknown films to challenge the inherited narratives of film history.</p>
  <p class="curating-explanation with-indent"><i>Cutaways</i> inhabits an interstitial space between academia and a wider public sphere, bringing together contributors who aim to advance film criticism as a domain of vibrant intellectual inquiry. It allows our best film writers to experiment with form and voice. While the series is grounded in a commitment to cinema, it conceives of filmmaking as a portal through which to consider culture, history, and politics.</p>
