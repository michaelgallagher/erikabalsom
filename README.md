## To do:
- Once the nav is settled, deploy to all parts.
- Nav: "you are here" needs fixing (may need to have a separate nav file for each page – redundant but avoids JS) – or use JS to select the correct link to highlight.
- Nav. for smaller screens – should roll-up, have a + button, and open/close on-click.
- Maybe refactor the CSS so that the inline UL stuff has one parent, instead of repeating some of it in the nav and go-to sections
- Breakpoint adjustments.


## Done:
- On smaller screens the "go to" module (top of Articles page) needs to become a vertical list
