Erika's site.
Built using Hugo.


## To do:
- Nav: for smaller screens – should roll-up, have a + button, and open/close on-click.
- Maybe refactor the CSS so that the inline UL stuff has one parent, instead of repeating some of it in the nav and go-to sections
- Breakpoint adjustments:
  - "go to" links


## Done:
- On smaller screens the "go to" module (top of Articles page) needs to become a vertical list.
- Nav: "you are here" needs to be assigned dynamically with JS.
